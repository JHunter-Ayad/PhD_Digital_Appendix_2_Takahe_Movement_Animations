# PhD_Digital_Appendix_2_Takahe_Movement_Animations
Digital appendix materials from my PhD Thesis at the University of Otago

This repository is the fourth digital appendix created to suplement my PhD thesis "Resources to Aid Decision-Making in Conservation Translocations" submitted to the University of Otago in November 2021.

As these digital appendices are not intended to be stand alone, a pdf of my completed thesis is also provided in an accompanying repository.

This final appendix provides .mp4 files containing animations of satelite tracking data collected as part of my thesis research for takahe reintroduced to Kahurangi National Park.

These animations were created using the MoveVis (Schwalb-Willmann J, Remelgado R, Safi K, Wegmann M 2020. moveVis: Animating movement trajectories in synchronicity with static or temporally dynamic environmental data in r. Methods in Ecology and Evolution 11(5): 664â€“669.) package in R. They were used to animate tracking data collected as described in Chapter 5 of my thesis and were refereneced extensively when designing and interpreting the analyses presented in Chapter 6 of my thesis.

The file naming conventions relate to the names given to individual birds by the takahe recovery group to which the track relates, followed after a hyphen by the ID number of the GPS satelite tracking device used to record the data.

No co-ordinates or source data are provided with these animations as such data are potentially sensitive and cannot be shared freely. Access to source data may potentially be provided via contacting the Takahe Recovery Group (https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/takahe-recovery-programme/meet-the-people/takahe-recovery-team/).
